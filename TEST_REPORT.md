# Data Viewer Verification Ledger

## Purpose

This file records commands actually run against specific repository states. It must not predict future results. Update it after meaningful baseline, checkpoint, and release verification.

## Legacy baseline — 2026-07-11

Environment: Windows workspace, active Python environment available to Codex. This baseline describes the legacy HDF5 Viewer code before Data Viewer implementation.

| Check | Command | Observed result | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python compilation | `python -m compileall -q core gui plugins services utils main.py` | passed | Python files parsed; runtime behavior unproven |
| Core tests | `python -m pytest tests/test_core.py -q` | 5 passed | narrow core subset only |
| Full collection | `python -m pytest --collect-only -q` | interrupted by 4 GUI import/collection errors | active environment lacks a complete working PyQt6 test setup; full suite status unknown |
| Static definitions | repository scan | 128 test functions/methods found | not equivalent to collected or passing tests |

Known evidence problems:

- legacy documentation claimed 121 passing tests and 100% pass rate without reproducible current evidence;
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds artifacts but does not run the full test suite before release;
- runtime/build naming and version sources disagree (`HDF5Viewer`, About version, and git tags);
- unconstrained `requirements.txt` lacks target format dependencies;
- test isolation from repository/user configuration is unproven.

## Documentation architecture pass — 2026-07-11

Scope: product, architecture, API, format, editing, plugin, workspace, UI, testing, dependency, migration, ADR, and execution-plan documentation. No product behavior is claimed implemented by this pass.

Verification run in the workspace on 2026-07-11:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `git diff --check` | passed; Git emitted only expected LF-to-CRLF working-copy warnings on Windows |
| required-document inventory | passed: 19 required root/docs/tasks files exist |
| ADR inventory | passed: 9 accepted ADR files exist |
| executable task inventory | passed: 86 unique `DV-####` task IDs |
| local Markdown link scan | passed: every relative Markdown link resolves to an existing path |
| stale-claim scan | passed: remaining `121 tests` / `100% pass rate` matches are explicitly labeled historical and untrusted |

These checks validate documentation structure and consistency only. They do not validate product behavior.

## Checkpoint record format

For each checkpoint append:

```text
Revision:
Date / OS / Python:
Dependency lock hash:
Commands:
Results (pass/fail/skip with reasons):
Performance fixture and hardware:
Package artifact and checksum:
Known gaps:
```

## Release evidence requirements

Data Viewer v1 requires current-revision evidence for all gates in `docs/TESTING.md`: full collection, lint, type check, unit/integration/offscreen GUI, adapter conformance, safe-edit fault tests, plugin numerical tests, workspace tests, performance budgets, visual/accessibility review, and installed-artifact smoke tests on Windows and Linux.

No report may use “100%” unless it names the measured denominator and includes the artifact. A passing build is not a passing application.
